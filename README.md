# v2v_communication-
complete simulation and communication framework for Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication integrating MQTT messaging, SUMO traffic simulation, VANET mobility modeling, and NS-3 network simulation. This demonstrates how real-time vehicle data can be exchanged reliably across a vehicular ad-hoc network for intelligent transportation systems (ITS).
